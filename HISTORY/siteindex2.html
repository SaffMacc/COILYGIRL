              <p>In early African civilisations, hairstyles could indicate a person's family background, tribe and social status.

"Just about everything about a person's identity could be learned by looking at the hair," says journalist Lori Tharps, who co-wrote the book Hair Story about the history of black hair.

When men from the Wolof tribe (in modern Senegal and The Gambia) went to war they wore a braided style, she explains. While a woman in mourning would either not "do" her hair or adopt a subdued style.

"What's more, many believed that hair, given its close location to the skies, was the conduit for spiritual interaction with God."</p>

              <p>It is estimated that 11,640,000 Africans left the continent between the 16th and 20th Centuries due to the transatlantic slave trade.

These slaves took many of their African customs with them, including their specially-designed combs.

"Their key is the [bigger] width between the teeth because African-type hair is very fragile," says Dr Sally-Ann Ashton, who curated an afro comb exhibition at Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum in 2013.

"Out of all the different [hair] types, it's probably the most fragile so if you're yanking a fine tooth comb through it, you're going to do an awful lot of damage."

During the 19th Century, slavery was abolished in much of the world, including the United States in 1865.</p>

              <p>The afro hair style, which emerged in the 1960s during the civil rights movement, was "a symbol of rebellion, pride and empowerment", says Mr Lynch.

As black people protested against racial segregation and oppression, the eye-catching style took off - an assertion of black identity in contrast to previous trends inspired by mainstream white fashions. And with it the African (or afro) comb re-emerged.

"It was never lost in Africa of course," says Dr Ashton. "But this was with the advent of black power and politics.

"The afro hairstyle became very popular and for that you need a long kind of pickâ€¦ it's quite high-maintenance."

In response to the racial politics of the time, the fist comb - with a handle shaped like the black power salute - was designed in the 1970s.

"A lot of people who were born in the 1980s and 90s think [the salute] is associated with Nelson Mandela, which it's not - it's just that he happened to use that salute when he was released from prison," says Dr Ashton.</p>
